# insta_follow_back

This is a simple python script that allows for the user to sort their
instagram following/follower data in order to see who doesn't follow them back

I was inspired to make this because Instagram has a cap on the number of users a single user can follow,
and I tend to reach that count. I needed people to unfollow, but I didnt want to sever the already lasting
relationships, so I needed to unfollow users who dont already follow me back.
Instagram has limited sorting features for followers, so I made an interactive and user friendly way to sort
through non mutual follows.

Needed:

1. Instagram data that can be requested by instagram.

2. Put the "follwers.json", "following.json", and this script into the same folder

3. Run the script through the terminal by calling "python instaFollow.py"

4. Have fun!
